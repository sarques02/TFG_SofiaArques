In this testing dataset you will find two zip files with all the input images and their corresponding ground truth images. Some networks require a text file citing all the images, which is also provided here (allweather.txt)
If you wish to modify the dataset adding or removing images, make sure the gt image has the same name as input. To simplify this task you can make use of the two codes provided: check.py will make sure both folders have the same images, if the delete parameter is set as true (--delete true), the differing images will be deleted. Lastly, create_txt.py will create the text file and save it in the folder.
