In this testing dataset you will find two zip files with all the input images and their corresponding ground truth images. Some networks require a text file citing all the images, which is also provided here (allweather.txt)
If you wish to modify the dataset adding or removing images, make sure the gt image has the same name as input. You can simplify this task using two provided scripts: call check.py with the name of the folders as parameters and it will check whether both folders have the same images; with the --delete true parameter, differing images are removed. Additionally, create_txt.py generates and saves the allweather.txt file in the folder.
